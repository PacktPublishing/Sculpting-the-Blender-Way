## What is this book about?
Blender 3D is a free and open-source program that can be used for every part of the 3D production pipeline. It has several robust feature sets for creating 3D art, which have contributed to its rising popularity in the last few years. Sculpting is perhaps the most enjoyable and artistic method for creating 3D art as it relies less on technical knowledge and focuses on artistic brushes. The latest release of Blender makes the sculpting feature set more powerful than ever, so now is an excellent time to learn it!

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Configure your graphics tablet for use in 3D sculpting
* Set up Blender’s user interface for sculpting
* Understand the core sculpting workflows
* Get the hang of using Blender’s basic sculpting brushes
* Customize brushes for more advanced workflows
